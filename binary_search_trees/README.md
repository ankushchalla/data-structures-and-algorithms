## Inserting
- Goal: By making a comparison at each level, insert a new node at the appropriate location. 

## Notes
- Insertion, searching: O(logn) best and average case. 
- Not guaranteed!
- Imagine a BST where you keep inserting elements that are greater than the previous element you inserted.
- You basically have a linked list: O(n) insertion and searching.
- Simple solution: Pick a different root.
